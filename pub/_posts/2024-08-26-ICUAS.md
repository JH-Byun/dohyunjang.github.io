üìÉ **Abstract**: Bilateral teleoperation of an aerial manipulator facilitates the execution of industrial missions thanks to the combination of the aerial platform's maneuverability and the ability to conduct complex tasks with human supervision. Heretofore, research on such operations has focused on flying without any physical interaction or exerting a pushing force on a contact surface that does not involve abrupt changes in the interaction force. In this paper, we propose a human reaction time compensating haptic-based bilateral teleoperation strategy for an aerial manipulator extracting a wedged object from a static structure (i.e., plug-pulling), which incurs an abrupt decrease in the interaction force and causes additional difficulty for an aerial platform. A haptic device composed of a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic arm and a gripper is made for the teleoperation of aerial wedged object-extracting tasks, and a haptic-based teleoperation method to execute the aerial manipulator by the haptic device is introduced. We detect the extraction of the object by the estimation of the external force exerted on the aerial manipulator and generate reference trajectories for both the aerial manipulator and the haptic device after the extraction. As an example of the extraction of a wedged object, we conduct comparative plug-pulling experiments with a quadrotor-based aerial manipulator. The results validate that the proposed bilateral teleoperation method reduces the overshoot in the aerial manipulator's position and ensures fast recovery to its initial position after extracting the wedged object.
